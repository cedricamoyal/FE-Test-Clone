Welcome to: A short test project for Front End Web Engineer

A) Creating a Git repo
I didn't do all the coding in one go.
Prior to start with this code test I was familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
But this exercise has been my first experience with SASS, Gulp and Mocha/Chai.
It is the reason why my commit are so far apart.

B) Form markup, styles and validation
For this part I had to learn some SASS.
I didn't have any problem. It should be all working.

C) Front end tests
For this part I tried to learn some Mocha and Chai.
I installed Mocha and Chai
I have been able to run 2 trial tests.
But I didn't figure out yet how to do relevant testing for the form.
Let me know if you want me to try again!

D) Build automation
For this part I had to learn some Gulp.
I managed to set up the needed task automation:
  # Compile your SASS (currently set as 'default')
  # Lint your JavaScript
  # Run my trial tests
It should be all working.

It has been an interesting exercise. It would be good to meet in order to talk about it.
See you soon.
